# Getting Starterd

Starter kit for building an online shop using Gatsby, Sanity, and Shopify; a spin-off from [Midway](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del-world/midway)

**This project is under active development; I'm repurposing the source code of a project I recently worked on and will be stripping it down to function as a starter. The documentation for the project should be updated soon.**
